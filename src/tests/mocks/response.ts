It is the third Starlink launch overall. Starlink is a low Earth orbit broadband internet constellation developed and owned by SpaceX which will eventually consist of nearly 12 000 satellites and will provide low latency internet service to ground terminals around the world. The booster for this mission is expected to land on OCISLY.',

      "SpaceX will launch a Crew Dragon capsule from LC-39A, KSC on a fully fueled Falcon 9 rocket and then trigger the launch escape system during the period of maximum dynamic pressure. As part of NASA'a Commercial Crew Integrated Capability program (CCiCap) this test will contribute valuable data to help validate Crew Dragon and its launch abort system. The Crew Dragon will be recovered by GO Searcher after splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean. This flight does not go to orbit. The booster and upper stage are expected to break up following capsule separation and there will be no landing attempt.",
